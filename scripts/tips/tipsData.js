-each object has a key:value (string) assoicated with it
-you will utilise the tipsCollection array inside the tipsList.js where it will be introduced to tips.js in a function.
...tips.js contains a function that creates a string based on tip keys that it is introduced to in the tipsList.js.. but it needs tipsList to do that, 
MODULARIZE YOUR CODE! GOTTA KEEP IT SEPERATED
... tipsList.js is dependent on tipsData.js... tipsData.js is not dependant on anything, at the moment.
